>Generative AI RAG-based application

>Django projects are a great way to gain practical experience working with language models. This project involves natural language processing and AI, helping to deepen your understanding.

>Build a Django application for advanced AI-driven solutions using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. Integrate pre-trained language models like GPT-3 or GPT-4 with a retrieval system to fetch relevant documents. Develop features for generating contextual responses, automated content creation, and personalized recommendations. Implement a feedback loop to continuously improve the systemâ€™s accuracy.
